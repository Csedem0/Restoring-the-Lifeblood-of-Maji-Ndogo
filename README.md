## Restoring the Lifeblood of Maji Ndogo – SQL Analysis (Week 1)

This repository documents Week 1 of my SQL journey analyzing the water accessibility crisis in Maji Ndogo.
This phase was all about stepping into real relational data, facing uncertainty, and learning through hands-on problem-solving—not theory.

📌 Project Overview

The Week 1 goal was simple but challenging: explore and understand an interconnected relational database and begin forming meaningful questions about water access across regions in Maji Ndogo.

Using eight linked tables, I performed exploratory queries, tested assumptions, and built the foundation for deeper analysis in the coming weeks.

🧠 What I Accomplished

Explored 8 interconnected tables (and successfully recovered after breaking them—twice)

Wrote my first meaningful SQL query revealing genuine insights about water access

Used DML operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) without corrupting the database

Created conditional filters that connected data to real-world decision-making

These tasks transformed abstract SQL concepts into practical, real-world analytical skills.

💡 Key Insight

The biggest lesson wasn’t technical—it was personal:

You don’t get ready by waiting. You get ready by starting before you feel ready.

In just seven days of real problem-solving, I learned more than months of theoretical study could offer.

Week 2 begins with a mix of excitement and fear—which means I’m exactly where I need to be.

## Restoring the Lifeblood of Maji Ndogo 2

This repository documents Week 2 of my ongoing SQL project exploring the water accessibility challenges faced by communities in Maji Ndogo.
What started as simple queries quickly evolved into a deeper investigation, uncovering patterns hidden beneath thousands of messy, real-world records.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this phase was to move beyond basic SQL operations and dive into advanced analytical techniques. By cleaning, transforming, and dissecting the dataset, I uncovered meaningful insights about water accessibility across different regions in Maji Ndogo.

This week focused on understanding the story behind the data—not just clean results, but the messy transformations that reveal what’s really happening on the ground.

🔍 Key Areas Explored

Window Functions: Used for trend analysis, ranking, and identifying outliers

Data Cleaning & Transformation: Restructuring inconsistent records to reveal hidden insights

Advanced Aggregations: Summaries and statistics across large datasets

Control Flow Functions: Conditional logic to refine results and test assumptions

Clustering Water Sources: Grouping locations by accessibility patterns to understand the scale of the crisis

These techniques helped expose deeper patterns that basic queries simply couldn’t show.

💡 Major Insight

The breakthrough moment came when clustering analysis revealed strong patterns in water source accessibility across communities.
The data stopped being just numbers—it became a narrative about real people and real challenges.

📘 What I Learned

Advanced SQL is more than complex query writing—it's about asking the right analytical questions.

Clean insights come from messy data that has been carefully transformed.

Techniques like ranking, partitioning, clustering, and anomaly detection can unlock insights in any dataset.

Each function mastered this week strengthens my ability to solve real-world problems using data.
